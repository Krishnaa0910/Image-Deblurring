Image Deblurring using Hybrid GAN


The hybrid Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) combining the Super-Resolution Network(SRN) Generator and PatchGAN Discriminator is utilized for obtaining the robust and efficient solution of image deblurring. The SRN is intended to learn from the training images and restore the details without using any artifacts that are utilized in the conventional methods. At the mean time the discriminator gives feedback about the images produced by the generator and helps the generator to produce high quality ,sharp images.  The dataset utilized for training and evaluation is GoPro dataset, which consist of pair of sharp and blur images. The developed model uses Mean Squared Error(MSE) and binary cross entropy for the generator and discriminator respectively. Peak signal to Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index are utilized for performance evaluation of the model. The hybrid model is compared with the Standalone model of SRN and GAN using the metrices of PSNR and SSIM. The model uses an effective, adaptable and computationally efficient approach for image deblurring utilizing SRN and PatchGAN to obtain enhanced performance.
